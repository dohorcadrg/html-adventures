						<p class="intro">The bunny’s mouth opened wide in shock. “But…. But.. How?” </p>
						<p> You smiled in confidence. “True. Block elements display in a new line. But Inline elements are technically on the same line." <p>
						<p> “HOW COULD YOU???” The bunny screamed like a spoilt little bunny.</p>
						<p> You thought she was about to be violent. You started to inch a little further away from the rabbit...</p>
						<p> But suddenly she laughed. The laugh seemed innocent, innocently sweet. “Ok! You win” She smiled cutely, and tilted her head to one side. Her long fluffy floppy ear rested on the side of her head. And the bow on her head tickled her nose.</p>
						<p> She sneeze a delicate little bunny sneeze, and a white giant key with a red ribbon came floating in front of you. </p>
						You reach for the key, but as soon as your fingers grasp for it, it suddenly disappeared and reappeared inside the last keyhole in the door….</p>
						<p> The bunny started giggling uncontrollably. The door’s handle turned on it’s own and slowly began to open up..</p>
						<p> You gaze into the other side of the door, as it slowly revels the contents of the other side. You awaited your freedom, to finally come home to where everything makes sense again. </p>
						<p> But as the door opened wide, you gasps. </p>
						<p> What you saw instead, surprises you… </p>
